which brings us to another issue.

means everytime we generate new hash, we have to man manually input file.

the new plugin comes in.

todo: 
show index.html of 5_cleaning

show HtmlWebpackPlugin

npm run build:minify

show dist folder -> index.html

open dist/index.html -> still not loading.

modify publicPath: 'dist/' -> publicPath: ''
