we want our customers to load faster the site.


ToDo:

npm run build

show the elements in the dom -> head tag -> style

in productio, if the file is big, will take more time to load
here we will extract the css into a bundle


show webpack.minify.config.js
show plugin:
MiniCssExtractPlugin

show rules


will extract our css into a new file.

npm run build:minify
show dist folder
show index.html
open index.html -> show that its in extracted file.
