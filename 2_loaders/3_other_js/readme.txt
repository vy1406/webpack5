why do we need this ? 

browser depend of specific ECMAscript specifications.
and those evolve all the time.


because browser dont natively support the latest versions of js.

we want to be able to use those new features.

There are some tools that convert new js codes into old js versions that 
those browsers support.

Called bable - a most popular compiler.

ToDo:
show we using this. property as a class property,
and its not supported in many browsers.
only methods.

Loaders:
babel/env:
compiles ECMAscript 6-10 into 5.
