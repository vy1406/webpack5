css:


ToDo:
show where we import css. 
show how we teach to load css

adding style-loader, css-loader

css-loader:
The CSS loader takes a CSS file and returns the CSS with
imports and url(...) resolved via webpack's require functionality
it doesnt actually do anything with the returned css

style-loader:
The style loader takes CSS and actually inserts it into the
page so that the styles are active on the page.

ToDo
npm run build
show elements, show style in header.
